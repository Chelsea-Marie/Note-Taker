# Note-Taker

The note taker application allows you to add notes with a title and content to a vertical list on the left of the screen. The titles of the notes are displayed, and when they are clicked again, the original note is shown. The application has delete buttons next to each note for future development so the user can delete notes that have been completed or are no longer needed.
